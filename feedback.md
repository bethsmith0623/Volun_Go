# FEEDBACK PROJECT 3

Fantastic job all around on this one team delta! I though you had a great inspiration for this application. I think it does hae a great real world application which makes it a great app to keep building upon, especially for you portfolio piece. The app had amazing styling, which its a huge deal. I thought you three made great use of the screen space too. Everything was full, and there didn't seem like there was a lot of dead space. Beth I thought you did a great job engaging with the other groups during their presentations. That's a great skill to have so keep it up! Ruben much better job all around during the presentation. You came out hot, clear, consice, with something to say. Keep up the great work. Michael, excellent job interacting with your team. From what I saw you three really got along together.
