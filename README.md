# Volun-Go!


#### Introduction


The purpose of the app is to provide a resource for community-minded individuals to locate and/or advertise volunteer opportunities. Many people want to give back to their community (or are part of a group that requires community service) but aren't aware of all the opprtunities that are around them. Volun-Go is the solution!

You can browse the opportunities already entered on the site and add the event to your account page if you want to participate in that volunteer opportunity. If you want to organize an opportunity that doesn't already exist, you can create the event for other users to see and select. If you find an organization whose events really speak to you, you can click a link that redirects you to their website for more information.

Volun-Go is the brainchild of Ruben Caceres, Michael Martinez and Beth Smith for our Python/Django project.
